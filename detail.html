                            <h3>Super-Normal</h3>
                            <p>Super-normal is an utterly ordinary house that sticks to essentials instead of fancy
                                design elements. It was designed as a minimal house with basic functions based on each
                                family member’s lifestyle under circumstances where the site was not selected. </p>
                            <p>The building owner bought a vacant lot in Yangpyeong in 2018. The local contractor
                                involved, however, failed to take steps in a timely manner, so the owner had to wait
                                long to acquire a development permit and get civil engineering work to begin. The owner,
                                who could not delay his moving plan any further, sold the lot and started to look for
                                alternative lots nearby. This is why we needed to design a house by taking uncertainties
                                into account; we set a few basic rules to define the exterior space and elevation and
                                then planned a design focused on essentials, such as terrace, lighting, interactive
                                interior, and yard.</p>
                            <p>The building is very simple in form. The fact that there were no restrictions on slant
                                lines for daylight and the average size and placement of lots and density of general
                                houses in housing sites near Sinhwa-ri, Yangpyeong, provided us with much leeway in
                                deciding on the appearance and materials of the house. A terrace was designed to make
                                connections between every interior space to the exterior space to help the family
                                appreciate the nature, in the shape of a pixelized hat that becomes narrower toward the
                                top. a large square window is created on the elevation facing south to eliminate a sense
                                of hierarchy of scales by maximizing the view and lighting. The stand-alone wooden
                                cylinder is used as a home studio.</p>
                            <p>Super-Normal, planned to be an ordinary, common object, has a structure that prepares it
                                for an undefined site. The centrality of the common space and the peripherality of the
                                private rooms and terrace determine the composition, and structural load bearing and
                                non-load-bearing walls are coordinated accordingly. The area of the programs and the
                                size of the terrace are variable so that the physical form of the building can be
                                adjusted to the site. There was no particular siting issue when the site was selected.
                                With sites nearby being almost even in size and being placed based on directions and
                                with its variability, Super-Normal turns into a product that is ‘Beyond Ordinary.’</p>
